Training Shifumi dapp 
===

> dapp : A decentralized application (dApp) is a type of distributed open source software application that runs on a peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain network rather than on a single computer. DApps are visibly similar to other software applications that are supported on a website or mobile device but are P2P supported

Goal of this training is to develop a shifumi game with smart contract. You will learn : 
- create a smart contract in jsligo,
- use specific chest functionality,
- apply a TDD (Test driven development) approach.
